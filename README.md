# Web-scraping
This a web-scraping project which involves scraping specific data from yelp business search.There is a sheet which has the URLs of search results of businesses in yelp. We'll need data of 20 businesses from each of these URL. We'll skip the sponsored businesses. Each URL has 10 results per page, so we'll have to get data of 2 pages of each URL.
Images and logos will need to be direct urls hosted on a server/dropbox with links to each image in cells. I've attached the list of urls you need to scrape. The total number of links is 8811 rows. So in total 176220 businesses. 8811 x 20 is 176220.
The spreadsheet shold be formated with the following columns;Name	Address	Phone Number	Website URL	Rating	Number of reviews	Business Description	Business Hours	Business Email	Business Categories	Service Area	Business Opening Year	Business Photos(1 to 10)	Payment Method	Owner Name	Fax Number	Alternate Phone Numbers	Products and Services	Company Size	No. of reviews	Facebook Link	Twitter Link	Instagram Link	Youtube Link	Linkedin link
